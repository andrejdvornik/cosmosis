explanation: >
    Latin hypercube sampling (LHS).
    A Latin hypercube sample [1] generates n points in [0, 1)^d.
    Each univariate marginal distribution is stratified, placing exactly one point in 
    [j/n, (j+1)/n) for j = 0,1,...,n-1.
    They are still applicable when n<<d.

    The latin hypercube is scaled to the prior ranges of each parameters and the resulting samples are used in sampling.
    The main parameter for the latin hypercube sampler is the number of sample points.
