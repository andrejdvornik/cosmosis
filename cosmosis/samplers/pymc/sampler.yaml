explanation: >
    PyMC is a probabilistic programming library for Python that allows users to fit 
    Bayesian models using a variety of samplers. This sampler interface allows CosmoSIS 
    to use PyMC's MCMC algorithms for parameter estimation.

    PyMC provides sophisticated MCMC algorithms including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) 
    and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which can be more efficient than traditional 
    Metropolis-Hastings algorithms for high-dimensional problems.

installation: >
    PyMC needs to be installed separately:

    pip install pymc  # to install centrally, may require sudo
    
    pip install pymc --user  # to install just for you
